This is a Wyse60 Emulator for Android. Right now, it's hard coded to initially connect to my RS-232 Bluetooth Transmitter. It will draw a few pages, but if they're too complex, it will freeze or start to draw incorrectly. I don't know how to fix this.

5.25.2023: drawing pages and using a system keyboard. I will look into converting to an in-app keyboard in the future. Apparently, I need to update the bluetooth system as most of it is on the verge deprecation, if they're not deprecated already

TODO:
  1. Keyboard [system keyboard](https://youtu.be/Za2E_1_mtyc)
